A clone of Netlfix's User Dashboard built with React, Redux, JavaScript, and CSS.

A User can currently create an account, manage account details, start a subscription, view the movie catalog, view a selected movie's details,

## Project Status

Deployed Link: https://netflix-be4d1.web.app/

Test Login: Netflix@testcom  password: Test1234

Video playback features are currently under development. Since we wont be able to show full length movies on this clone, I have decided to just include trailer playbacks in the selected movie detail's view.

## Reflection


This was a 2 week long project that I built to attempt to clone Netflix. The overall goal was to utilize technologies I already knew and build up on them and familarizing myself with documentation for any new featues

I wanted to test my ability if I can develop a Web App as closely to Netflix and allowing users to pull data from a Movie API.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Auth and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. The Clone has subscription functionalities and handles payments with Stripe's newly released Firebase Extension. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into planning and building out the components needed to make the Web App look like Netflix.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
