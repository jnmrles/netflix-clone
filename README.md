## Reflection

  - What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
  - What did you set out to build?
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
  - What were some unexpected obstacles?
  - What tools did you use to implement this project?
      - This might seem obvious because you are IN this codebase, but to all other humans now is the time to talk about why you chose webpack instead of create react app, or D3, or vanilla JS instead of a framework etc. Brag about your choices and justify them here.  

#### Example:  

This was a 3 week long project built during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the Twitter API based on what they were interested in, such as 'most tagged users'. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-4.0` and `redux`.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, Auth0, and two-factor authentication using Firebase or other third parties. Due to project time constraints, I had to table authentication and focus more on data visualization from parts of the API that weren't restricted to authenticated users.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, LoDash, D3, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a `webpack.config.js` file to more fully understand the build process.















This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
