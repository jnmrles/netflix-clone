## Netflix Clone with React.js


A clone of Netlfix's User Dashboard built with React, Redux, JavaScript, and CSS.

A User can currently create an account, manage account details, start a subscription, view the movie catalog, and view a selected movie's details.

## Project Status

Deployed Link: https://netflix-be4d1.web.app/

Test Login: Netflix@testcom  password: Test1234

Video playback features are currently under development. Since we wont be able to show full length movies on this clone, I have decided to just include trailer playbacks in the selected movie detail's view.

## Reflection


This was a 2 week long project that I built to attempt to clone Netflix. The overall goal was to utilize technologies I already knew and build up on them and familarizing myself with documentation for any new featues

I wanted to test my ability if I can develop a Web App as closely to Netflix and allowing users to pull data from a Movie API.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Auth and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. The Clone has subscription functionalities and handles payments with Stripe's newly released Firebase Extension. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into planning and building out the components needed to make the Web App look like Netflix.

I plan to add playback features to preview trailers for any selected movie. Since I can playback full movies, I wont currently implement a Movie Viewer view and plan to utilize YouTube's API to retrieved a selected movie's trailer.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
